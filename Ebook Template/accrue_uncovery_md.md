# THE GOOD NEWS

## ALL HUMAN HERE
*Person-to-person customer service is our secret sauce.*

### Internal Stakeholder Perspectives

> "[Many clients] love the fact that they can pick up the phone and actually speak to a human being on the other end. … High touch is a great way to describe it."

> "If someone's asking me about Heartland and what's different, … I would say – without being cliche – service is our secret sauce. We have dedicated U.S.-based service, [and a] dedicated contact for each and every client."

> "When [clients] run into … an issue, … they have someone to call who will answer the phone on the second ring. [They'll] be able to talk to someone who knows the answer."

> "We have a single point of contact and one payroll specialist assigned to your account. That service model at the bigger payroll companies has long been dissolved. … Service was a very easy thing to say that we could win business on, because service is always something that a client … thinks [could be] better."

> "The fact that we have a dedicated service representative for each of our clients, regardless of their size – and that it's a US-based service – is unique to this industry. [When I worked for another provider,] I was accustomed to clients calling an 800 number, getting whoever they got. … So to be able to say, 'It's all US-based and you're going to have a dedicated contact,' that was huge."

> "I think sometimes what moves the needle is that we're a smaller nationwide company. … They're going to get more attention and service than they are getting with the big guys. … They're not going to be just a number."

> "[With] Paychex [or] ADP, you're going to call, [and] you're not going to get a rep right away. They're going to try and avoid you talking to a human as much as humanly possible. … With over a million clients, they just cannot do that anymore. We're in a place right now in the market where we still can do that, so it can be our differentiator."

> "Heartland Payroll is mainly known for our customer service and our service model."

> "Our retention of clients in comparison to when I was [working] at [a competitor] is substantially greater."

> "The value add for Heartland is that single point of contact, [the] payroll specialist. Plus you get me as your sales rep locally. You [can] text or call me anytime. … So now the business owner's like, 'Okay, I see you're investing in my success. [I've] got a single point of contact, you're saving me upwards of 100K a year, potentially.' All of the stars start to align."

**COUNTERPOINTS:**

> "[Sometimes] clients can't get through to their payroll specialist, so they call their salesperson, [and then the] salesperson starts emailing in or calling in to try to get help, and then you have an operations team that's frustrated by their sales team, and we're not following through on a service level."

> "Our customer support ratings have gone way down, and it's been disheartening."

> "We have to get a better and bigger tax team, … because when something's not paid on time or correctly, [clients get] a nasty letter from the state and from the IRS, and then they're sending that to us. Then we tell them, 'Hey, we'll look into it,' but we're taking six weeks to get back to somebody who's freaked out that they got an IRS letter for not doing our job."

### External Stakeholder Perspectives

> "[What I like best about Heartland is that] I can always reach someone. [My service rep] calls to remind me at least a couple of times before they actually process [payroll]."

> "I would recommend Heartland to anybody who has the kind of business I have, where they need that customer service."

> "I love my representative. … She's great. She keeps on top of me, and she's really good."

> "The customer service [is easy on] both ends – both the ACA and the payroll people. I would say 99% of the time you get a person."

> "ADP didn't really want to [work with us over the phone] any more. That's what led us to [switch]. And then we got a payroll specialist with Heartland who was willing to do the phone calls. … [I've] been [working] with the [same] woman for a couple years now, and I absolutely love her."

> "It's very easy [to get up and running]. You have someone who's assigned to you, and they've always been very nice."

> "If [my service rep] is out or on the phone and I can't wait for her to call payroll in, one of her team members will take it over. So they accommodate you in that capacity as well. Meaning if I'm in a rush … someone else will do it from her team."

**COUNTERPOINTS:**

> "I've been waiting two months for an answer on a bill that I keep getting for unemployment insurance, … and I still don't have an answer. Now, that has nothing to do with my payroll specialist, because she's not the tax department. … And she's like, 'They say they're still working on it. They need X amount of weeks to figure it out.' So, I would just say that they got to speed up the tax department, because these bills, if I do owe them, I'm getting charged interest while they're trying to figure it out, so that would be my only complaint."

## EASY DOES IT
*With our intuitive platform, customers can get to-dos done fast and get back to business.*

### Internal Stakeholder Perspectives

> "[When] we show our software to [clients,] … the response is hands down, consistently, … 'This is so much easier than what I'm using today.' So don't take it from me. I take it from my clients and the prospects that I meet with. Our software truly is more intuitive. It's easier to use."

> "You're able to do a lot of stuff in [the platform] without having to outsource to someone else or reach out to someone consistently. You're able to just go in here and use it for what it's for. You don't have to do a lot of fighting within the website to simply complete your action item."

> "The newer clients who are starting on our newer platform love it. … They can appreciate that it's all pretty much at their fingertips, and they don't really have to [ask us for anything]."

> "So for a lot of clients who've been doing [payroll] manually or they really just don't know how to operate their current system, this is such a user-friendly system that they really love."

> "If you're hiring employees all the time … you fill out a stack of paper. … We have … an onboarding solution where you … can customize those onboarding packages. … All [the onboarding] information [is] automatically uploaded in the payroll system. [That] streamlines a lot of those onboarding struggles that the client would have."

> "Heartland Hire [is] the best thing we do. … It includes applicant tracking, where you're posting a job. You take that job, you hire somebody, you onboard them through an electronic onboarding process. [And] we also have the ability to screen those employees for a federal tax credit. [Clients can] use … the WOTC screening with every new hire."

> "Clients … have the ability to go in and build their own custom report, which I think is great. … [For example,] if on Saturday they decide they need birthdates for all 150 of their employees, they can go in and create a report in 10 minutes if they need to."

> "The data that is captured within our reports – it's super easy to access … once the client is comfortable with the system. … [They can] just log in and pull whatever report they need."

> "[For] reports, [we have a] super easy system to go in and look at archive reports by pay period. This is probably what my clients use the most. They can easily just download [them and] add info as they need."

> "If [a customer is] utilizing QuickBooks and Intuit, we can help them to connect them through APIs into our system and make it easier, so they're not having to uproot everything they've already become familiar with. … They can just have that information flow right in with us."

> "It's a really robust system, especially if you've been doing [payroll] manually or you've got a basic kind of old DOS system for payroll. This is blasting you into the future in terms of user interface, ease of use, all of that."

> "[For one client,] we took her 10 hours of payroll processing down to 10 minutes, and we did that on one call with them. … She was crying happy tears. She was like, 'This is phenomenal. I love this.'"

**COUNTERPOINTS:**

> "We don't have [a] great mechanism [for] how we train our customers on our software when they become new clients. … There's certain things that clients cannot do in our system from an access standpoint. … I think we could be much more forward-facing on the ability of our clients to service themselves. … I would say that's a weakness right now for sure."

### External Stakeholder Perspectives

> "It was pretty easy to get on board with the system. It didn't take much. As far as the software, it's pretty easy to maneuver. That's what we like about it."

> "The software itself is pretty straightforward. You won't have any problems on that end."

> "I can do the payroll from home, remotely. I did that when we were on vacation."

**COUNTERPOINTS:**

> "The only complaint [I get from my accountant] … is the reports … are a little bit more difficult to read than, let's say, ADP's."

## EXTRA-MILERS
*We go beyond selling our clients a product to actually helping them solve their problems.*

### Internal Stakeholder Perspectives

> "Where Heartland sets itself apart is our problem resolution. Okay, there's an error? Forget how it happened. … I don't care if it's a client problem or Heartland problem, but how quickly can we resolve it?"

> "I'm not selling a product. I'm really selling a solution – a service. … It's a long-term relationship."

> "We quite often bend over backwards to take payroll and manipulate it for our customers so it'll fit their needs and get their employees paid exactly how they need to be paid. We try to humanize everything."

> "If it takes us eight hours to do an audit of their accrual plan to make sure that their employees have the right time off showing on their pay stub, we're going to do that because it's the right thing to do. And we've tried to build a very intentional culture. That is why our customers stay with us. … [We have] that level of commitment."

> "I enjoy creating custom reports. A lot of clients need information about random things at random times, and the ability to go in and just create a custom report for exactly what they need is extremely helpful [to them]."

> "Our job is to understand what [the customer's] needs are and where their pain points are, and then, solve them."

> "If it's 7:00 p.m. on Friday or 10 a.m. on a Saturday, and something's keeping you up or something has you frustrated, and you're not able to get a hold of your dedicated rep, I want you to call me. That's very different in this industry and that's just part of the culture here."

> "Without a doubt, [our top strength is] that customer-centric approach, not only from the first interaction, but straight through for the lifecycle of the client."

> "If you're a salesperson at Heartland, your job is to be your client's advocate. … It's to go to the right people in our organization and describe what's happening … [so] the right people can solve it."

> "Our goal is to build or form relationships with our clientele. We don't want anyone to feel like they're a number in our 50,000 client base. So we put a very heavy focus on ensuring that they feel comfortable and know that if they've sent their payroll to [a specific person], [that person] is going to take care of it."

> "The stark difference between Heartland Payroll and the industry today is [the] client-first mentality, and that begins with the sales."

> "A [team member] invested not only the drive time out [to a distant prospect], but also an hour and 45 minutes opening up his mind to what was really bogging him down. She ultimately earned that client, because maybe some other vendors … just weren't willing to drive that distance to … sit down shoulder to shoulder and learn what's broken in their business."

> "We have a collection of people and employees here at Heartland who really take pride in our ability to [take care of customers]. And when a customer calls, if they have a complicated question, … we take pride in solving the hard problem. We don't just pass it off to the next person."

> "Some of our competitors, it's kind of a 'sign the deal and move on' mentality. And that is the complete opposite of Heartland, [which] is a relationship-based sale."

> "Instead of being transactional, … here at Heartland, … whether [a customer has] five employees or 500, … I get to retain … those relationships. So that absolutely was a big piece [of why I wanted to work here]."

### External Stakeholder Perspectives

> "[Heartland is] very easy to deal with. They do all the work. I just give them the hours [to run payroll]."

> "[An employee] had been shorted [some payment] because it wasn't running through the payroll. When he finally noticed it, Heartland split the cost with me, meaning they took 50% responsibility [and] we took 50%. Whose fault was it? I don't know. But they were willing to split the mistake with me, so I was grateful."

> "We usually call in our payroll on a Monday, … [and] we're done by 12:00 noon."

> "Anytime I ask [my service rep] to do something with money … through an email, she immediately picks up the phone. She's like, 'Hey, is it this legit?' I'm like, 'Yeah, we're good,' and then she does it, so she's super efficient and … double-checking. So, that to me was obviously really, really impressive."

> "Since being with Heartland, we've opened at least two [or three] companies. … They have helped [us] transition starting from scratch."

> "If my employee's like, 'Hey, my time's wrong,' it's like, 'I didn't do it; the payroll company did. But we'll get it fixed. It's not a problem.' I like that I'm not 100% responsible for the mistakes that are made."

> "We were prominent in [one state], but I didn't know all the [payroll] rules in [another state]. [Heartland was] extremely helpful in making sure we had all the right things. … They handled it."

> "If they don't know what the answer is, they get me the answer."

## FRIENDLIER TERMS
*From pricing locks to residual models, our sales infrastructure incentivizes long-term customer relationships.*

### Internal Stakeholder Perspectives

> "We want [clients] around for the long term. So while I can't look [you] in the eyes and tell you you're never going to have a price increase, … what I can tell you is [the] first three years [the price is] not going to change. After that, it's going to be pretty darn minimal. Because we want your partnership for years and years to come."

> "How sales people get compensated at Heartland … is based on client retention. [It creates] a different behavior … within the whole organization, not just sales."

> "Our sales reps get lifetime residuals. So as long as the customer stays with us, [the sales rep gets] monthly payments. … That means the sales rep stays involved in that relationship throughout the life of that client. … I would say that's a strength."

> "I think that [our pricing model] is a fundamental difference, and it still is a reason why I still get business – because I can guarantee our price for three years."

> "I'm actually building something with those residuals that will essentially be an annuity or a pension. When I leave this company, Heartland's going to keep on paying me. That blew my mind. That was big."

> "The cool thing with Heartland is they … have [price] parameters, … and I can go anywhere in [that threshold]. That is really awesome for me [as a salesperson] to have, because I know what Paychex charges; I know what ADP charges; and I can go in between those and offer a pricing solution. [I can] also say that your price isn't going to go up for three years."

> "Our salespeople … have the ability to create pricing, with a lot of autonomy."

> "Heartland does [price] differently. We do a three-year price lock, and [that's] not to say we won't ever have a price increase after that, but it really is pretty minimal."

> "While we do a lot [of sales] in our community, in our backyard, we also have the opportunity to work across the country. So if I develop a relationship with a broker CPA and they call me up and say, … 'I've got a client down in Florida that could use your assistance. Can you help them?' If I was at ADP, short answer was, 'No, let me get them introduced to my peer … down in Florida,' and then we would've had to split that deal. Here, … my team can work deals across the country. And we don't have to split those. That … caught my attention."

**COUNTERPOINTS:**

> "I would say everybody [is cheaper than Heartland]. … Our competitors have a tremendous amount of flexibility to beat our price."

### External Stakeholder Perspectives

> "Heartland's pay scale is on the lower end of other payroll companies, so obviously that is a huge plus."

---

## MORE HEART
*We attract sales professionals who aren't just good at their jobs – they genuinely care about our customers.*

### Internal Stakeholder Perspectives

> "Our sales professionals are … definitely one of the top three [strengths], in terms of the individuals that we're hiring. They're not inexperienced, they're not rookies. They're high tenured, [with] high professionalism."

> "Genuinely, every time I sit down with a small business owner, I want to hear their story, … [I want clients] to know that this isn't a one-time transaction. … You will truly be a part of my book of clientele that I'll retain for as long as you'll allow me to. That resonates with them."

> "We … have a pretty high-performing field sales team that is motivated by our comp plan. I think our ability to distribute our product is really good, and we have so many more opportunities to do it in other avenues, like self-select or inside sales. But our field sales, I think, is a strength of ours."

> "When [Heartland] acquired Ovation, … there were only about 25 salespeople. But they are 25 … let's call them 'Trusty Dusties.' Very experienced, very successful, and tenured payroll sales reps."

> "Our comp plan incentivizes us through residuals for [help] to retain those clients – to take care of them. So people that naturally want to nurture and help clients … in the past … just did it pro bono. And here it's like, 'I get compensated for rolling up my sleeves and taking care of my clients.'"

> "How we get compensated at Heartland is based on client retention. So, it creates a different behavior, meaning there's a lot of incentive [to be service focused]."

> "We have a unique comp system or model that pays our salespeople residual income. … All referral partners love that because they see a sales rep who's literally compensated to be a part of the service model."

> "ADP reps, … they don't really care. … But with Heartland, since we're paid on a residual basis, we want this client to be happy with us forever and for us to be the last payroll company [they] ever use."

## IN WITH THE NEW
*The Acrisure acquisition has everyone excited.*

### Internal Stakeholder Perspectives

> "I think the world is our oyster. I think that if we do this right and well, and Acrisure being the company that it is – which is innovative, and tech-driven, and service-driven – we could personify that within our payroll business. And we can make a real impact."

> "As I've told my partners who are nervous about this acquisition, I'm super excited about it. The reason I am is because I feel like we have been ignored for many years. … I'm excited [about] … Acrisure. … They're not going to sit there and buy us for over a billion dollars and not invest in making us better."

> "What I love about where we are is [that] Acrisure is going to invest in us. We need the investment from a training and operations standpoint. We need better candidates, we need better payroll specialists who are trained, and we need better technology. We need our system to be more reliable and more robust, and we need a tech stack. We need integrations to more workers' comp carriers and 401k carriers and health insurance. … That's exciting. Acrisure will do that."

> "What's … exciting is to not be secondary [as a business priority]. We will be a small payroll company and nothing will be lost and neglected and the business will be run as a payroll business."

> "Once you start getting up to 400, 500, 800 employees, they expect additional human capital management solutions. … Like learning management systems, employees being able to phone in, … almost like a call center, where we can … [answer] day-to-day questions that are pulling their managers or HR people away from other things that they should be doing. … As you go upmarket, they want more and more HR support. We're now able to do that."

> "I think the other payroll companies are watching us. … Although we will be the solution for Acrisure brokers, we can be the solution for so many more. We can be the solution for non-Acrisure brokers, CPAs, financial advisors, [and] the like. We're positioned very well to do something very cool, and hopefully we do it well."

**COUNTERPOINTS:**

> "I love the fact that we don't [sell insurance like ADP and Paychex], because it allows me to partner with insurance providers and 401(k) providers, and I'd love to maintain that. … I'm a little nervous with the acquisition that we are going to become an insurance company, because that's what I've been preaching against."

> "NewCo is a real problem to solve with non-Acrisure brokers because, … [the] objection right now is going to be, 'Who the [heck] are you guys? You just got acquired? Big problem. I don't like that. That sounds like chaos for me.'"

## IN GOOD COMPANY
*We have a great culture where we're in it to win it – together.*

### Internal Stakeholder Perspectives

> "My friends and family, they're in awe all the time about the stories that I share [about] how well Heartland takes care of all of its employees. It's a really special place."

> "What I've really loved about this company is it feels very employee and people-centric. … Because that's the focus. We grow and develop great professionals, which then translates to amazing service to our customers. Because when you love your job, you do your job better."

> "Heartland felt more like an environment where we value our employees as much as we value our clients, and I wanted to be a part of that."

> "I think we've created something [where] we're all in it together. We've all been through the good times and the bad times, and we want those good times back. We believe in this leadership [and] that we're going to get back there."

> "Part of our culture here is servant leadership and being out there shoulder to shoulder. So I'm out in the field quite a bit with members of my team, helping them move deals through the sales pipeline and close."

> "The people are the secret sauce. I mean, we have so many caring individuals."

> "We have a lot of folks that have worked together forever. … We have something special from a culture standpoint that is really second to none. Heartland fostered that culture significantly."

> "[The culture is] very special. And I hate to use the word unique. Because every company thinks they are, but for me, [compared to my previous workplace,] it was night and day. So it's pretty awesome."

> "I'm super impressed with everybody who's in a leadership position. Their willingness to help, and jump when you need [them] to jump, and to take care of something that needs to be taken care of – there is a genuine plan of action always in place."

> "Our greatest asset and our greatest resource is our people."

**COUNTERPOINTS:**

> "Between payroll, sales, and operations, we have a culture issue. We pretend like we love each other, … and we over celebrate because we're trying to build that camaraderie. If you're operations, … it's hard to feel partnered with sales. Sales might feel like a problem to you. … When you need less sales involvement [in helping customers get service], that will solve for it."

# THE BAD NEWS

## TIME TO RETOOL
*When it comes to technology, we're playing catch-up.*

### Internal Stakeholder Perspectives

> "The reality is we … have a lot of room for technology improvements."

> "Client-facing technology is a weakness. … We are not on the cutting edge. … In order for our business to really supercharge and start to scale, we need to create more self-service options."

> "[Our] technology [is] okay. But … when you get somebody shopping for state-of-the-art technology with 50 … [or] 100-plus employees, and they know the right questions to ask, … they're going to find there's a difference in terms of our product offering versus a Paylocity."

> "Our technology [is] not as advanced as some of these other companies."

> "Some of our competitors like Gusto, they can almost poke fun at us – that we're … the antiquated method of payroll, and they're the cutting edge."

> "We don't have a tech stack that is competitive with most payroll companies."

> "As far as technology is concerned, we're behind our competitors. We need to have … a better integrated platform. … Some of our competitors have … an open API. They can integrate with any 401(k) provider out there, any benefit enrollment solution, time clock, [etc.]"

> "A lot of the tech that we have for our reps is outdated. [It] doesn't allow them to be as productive and targeted on what companies they should be focused on. … [There are] glitches and frustrations, [and we're] doing a lot on spreadsheets."

> "For tax issues, … clients don't really have any visibility to where their things sit. If they have a tax notice, they have to reach out to their payroll specialist in order to get a status update. … There's no portal. … I think that would be an opportunity to make the service experience much more seamless."

> "Paylocity kicks our butt when it comes to their open API and how many different solutions outside of payroll and HR that they can actually integrate with. … We've been promised … that we're going to have an open API, that we're going to be able to integrate with a lot more vendors, and we just haven't gone there yet."

> "We don't have … some of the technology. Things that [businesses] would require we don't have."

**COUNTERPOINTS:**

> "Our technology, while it's not cutting edge, it serves the masses. And a lot of businesses … that I've spoken with over my years here, they like the simplicity."

> "The newer system … moves a lot faster than probably any other payroll platform I've ever seen. … It moves faster; it holds a lot of data."

---

## AND YOU ARE ... ?
*To know us is to love us. But too many people don't know us.*

### Internal Stakeholder Perspectives

> "Unfortunately, we're the industry's best kept secret. That's not a good place to be when you're in sales."

> "We're not known in the payroll industry. What we're known for is credit card processing, payment processing, POS, all that. … That's what Heartland was built on."

> "[A] weakness [is] probably brand recognition. … It's like, 'Oh, I haven't heard of you before. You guys new?' It's like, 'No, we've been around since '97.' … It's the lack of visibility of our brand out in the market."

> "There's one of me. There's probably 40 sales reps at ADP that sell in this area. … They do a great job of overwhelming the business community, which is kind of good and kind of bad. Meaning people have an opinion about Paychex or ADP, and … because we're a newer company relative to the two of them, there's not as many business owners that have formed an opinion."

> "One of the biggest [objections] we hear all the time is, 'I've never heard of your company.' … So there's not brand recognition."

> "Nobody knows Heartland for payroll. There's no brand recognition. We don't sponsor a golfer. We don't have our name at a football stadium."

> "If you're familiar with our industry, let's say you're a CFO or you're an HR person, … those larger competitors have set themselves apart from us, just from a branding perspective. They've invested more money."

---

## SHOW ME THE MONEY
*Over the last several years, we've suffered from a lack of investment.*

### Internal Stakeholder Perspectives

> "We've always been secondary to payments – a redheaded stepchild, if you will. … So we … grow and then we contract because we're not ready for the growth [and] not ready to support clients in the way that clients are expecting to be supported."

> "Because we've been such a small piece of a large business in Global Payments, we have been asked year after year after year to do more with less. … There just hasn't been the amount of investment in internal tools that we need."

> "Global … wasn't investing in the business."

> "I came from a company [where] they warm up to the accounting community. They give them tax guides at the end of the year for free, … and they have an expense budget where they get to take CPAs to lunch [to] get to know their business. … We don't do any of that at Heartland. There is no budget for that."

> "[Until recently,] each individual payroll specialist had their own Gmail account. … If that payroll specialist was on PTO, they had to forward an email string to their buddy sitting next to them and say, 'Hey, while I'm on PTO, can you handle this?'"

> "Our operations team has been under invested in."

> "Over the last 10 years, our product … hasn't changed a lot. Our ability to service that client has not changed a lot, meaning we have not invested in the business. … Whether it's the marketing side, whether it's the branding side, whether it's the service side, whether it's the technology, what we're missing is investment in all of those things."

> "We haven't been invested in. Heartland … is known for … payment processing. That's where they make most of their money. I would go to these events in Vegas … with the credit card processing reps, and they talk about payroll for less than 5% of the time. … 90 to 95% of the time is talking about their main moneymaker, which is credit card processing."

## SIBLING RIVALRY
*Our unique compensation model can sometimes cause tension between departments.*

### Internal Stakeholder Perspectives

> "We have salespeople getting too involved with trying to service the model."

> "It can sometimes feel in operations like we don't just have one client, we have two clients: We have the business owner and then we have the sales rep. So that can create some challenges with us."

> "Our service … is our strength. … But service is never perfect. … And … our people are paid on retention. … So we've lost reps because they got frustrated because they felt service didn't do their job. … And it's like, 'I'm losing residuals on accounts that I sold that service isn't servicing properly.' … And my experience is it's usually somewhere in the middle when there's a problem between the service provider and the client. Something maybe they did or didn't do that created a problem."

> "I refer to our salespeople lovingly as velociraptors. They learn what they need to do that maybe [the] … tax department isn't doing. … All that means is [a salesperson is] selling less. [He's] frustrated because [he's] doing too much, and he's handling issues almost consistently in his day."

> "You have the sales rep who's like, 'I don't need this in my life. … I should be able to sell. I'm a salesperson and I'm doing too much servicing.'"

> "There's a tug and pull between operations and sales in our organization because of the way that our comp model is."

> "Any salesperson at any company in any industry, … [might say], 'Oh, I did my job. I sold it, and then service didn't service it properly.' It's no different here. … And guess what? When we get it right, it's silence. Our phones don't ring. But if you get it wrong, there's certain things people don't like messed with in their lives, and their [paycheck] is one of them. So you're going to hear about it."

> "Guess who [clients are] sending those [tax issue] letters to? They're sending them to me, and then I'm having to send them to the tax team. I see all of this stuff going on, and it's taken me away from my job, which is sales."

# THE INDUSTRY FRUSTRATIONS
*Common pain points and frustrations with the industry (not with Accrue)*

## Internal and External Stakeholder Perspectives

### Who cares?
> "It's really just service [that clients want] – the ability to pick up the phone and talk to someone. And if somebody's going to leave their payroll provider, it's because in a lot of cases, … they don't feel like they're being cared for. They don't feel like anybody cares." (Internal Stakeholder)

> "Customer service is expensive for [competitors] because they have hundreds of thousands of clients. So whether they're investing in AI or they're investing in automated phone systems, clients just don't feel cared for." (Internal Stakeholder)

### Too many reps
> "I would say probably 60% of our business would come from ADP and Paychex takeaways. … ADP's got a million clients. … Paychex [has] like 800,000. A lot of those people become numbers, and they lose their rep. They're talking to 10 different service reps." (Internal Stakeholder)

### Always on hold
> "The pain points that we hear are, … 'I don't get served. I'm in a phone queue, I'm calling 1-800, and I sit on hold for 45 minutes to an hour [before] somebody gets on the phone.' So the primary pain point is customer service." (Internal Stakeholder)

### Language barriers
> "Every time we called ADP, we got someone who wasn't in the United States. It was hard to understand them." (External Stakeholder)

> "Sometimes that person with ADP and Paychex could be answering overseas as well, and people hate that." (Internal Stakeholder)

### Integration issues
> "[One client's] big sticking point was that with Paychex Oasis, they could not figure out their general ledger interface to QuickBooks online. So she was manually entering probably a hundred lines of data each bi-weekly pay period, which took her about eight to 10 hours a week every time she would do it." (Internal Stakeholder)

### No phone service
> "[With] ADP … a lot of mistakes were happening. We had always had a payroll specialist, and then … they were trying to convert everybody to inputting that information online yourself, where we had been used to calling it in on the phone, and that's what we were most comfortable doing." (External Stakeholder)

### Hiring hiccups
> "Some of [our competitors] will offer … the ability to screen for [WOTC], but it's very clunky. … With our competitors, if that employer wants to see, 'Hey, is there a potential tax credit here for hiring this individual?' I've got to send them out to a completely separate website." (Internal Stakeholder)

### Conflicts in cross-selling
> "When I was at Paychex and I would sell a client on payroll, they would immediately get called by our 401(k) teams and our insurance teams. I couldn't stand that, because I had no control over who was going to call my client." (Internal Stakeholder)

> "ADP and Paychex are stealing clients away from insurance brokers all over the country now. Insurance brokers hate ADP [and] Paychex because they're competition." (Internal Stakeholder)

**TAGLINE/THEMELINE:** Happy payday!  
**TONE:** Conversational. Personable. High-energy.

### Messaging Strengths
**Energetic voice makes payroll seem … almost fun?**
- "Give us a ring" (customer service)
- "You won't pay a cent until you're ready to run payroll"
- Name ("Gusto") means enjoyment, vigor
- "Happy Payday!" (themeline)

**"One place" / "all-in-one" messaging highlights integrations strength**
- "One place to keep your team happy and productive"
- "No matter the size or stage of your business, Gusto's all-in-one HR platform puts the tools you need to hire, pay, and manage your team at your fingertips"
- "All your apps and data, together in one place"

**Quippy lines make the product feel easy**
- "You're three steps away from easy, automated payroll"
- "Questions? Meet answers."
- "E-sign and you're done"
- "Life's easier when systems talk" (integrations)

**Customer stories keep tech-focused product from feeling cold**
- "Snapbar saves 15 hours a month on payroll by using Gusto" (case study with team photo)

- "Every new Gusto hire gets a welcome box filled with goodies from real Gustomers, aka the small businesses we're proud to support every day" (Instagram)

### Messaging Weaknesses
**Key benefits are a bit expected, déjà vu**
- "… easy, automated payroll"
- "Compliance, accuracy, and peace of mind" (Payroll product page)
- "You and your employees will get the peace of mind you need to do your best work"
- "Payroll, HR, benefits. Simplified." (homepage hero headline)

**Core purpose ("We're making work meaningful for everyone, everywhere" – About page) likely overpromises**

**Themeline ("Happy payday!") is used inconsistently**
- Appears prominently on social sites but not on website
- Message as a whole could benefit from a creative unifier

### Other Prominent Themes
**Time saved**
- "Run payroll in minutes with smart technology"
- "Payroll takes just a few clicks"
- "Saved over 80 hours a year" (testimonial)

- 2023 Paychex Survey "reveals what HR leaders are focusing on in the next 12 months"

### Messaging Weaknesses
**Clunky moments may contradict claims of "simple"**
- FAQs at the bottom of homepage include information that should be clear from other messaging, with questions like, "What Is Paychex?" and "Does Paychex Do Payroll?"
- Many CTAs feel like they'll take work, such as "Start Building Your HCM Today", "Find Your Solution", and "See What Package Fits Your Business Needs"
- "Get Help Logging In to Paychex Flex" (global footer link)

**"Me-first" at times**
- "How Our Solutions Work"
- "See how our people plus our technology equals your solution"
- "Hear From Some of Our Customers"
- "Our HCM Solution does it all in one, seamless and user-friendly platform"
- "Choose Paychex for Security, Compliance, and Support"
- "Recognized for Innovation, Ethics, and Performance" – a nice claim, but doesn't translate the benefit for the customer

**High-level messaging is mixed, muddling the takeaway**
- "Everything you need to find, pay, and manage your team in one platform" (homepage hero subhead)
- "A Simple Approach to Payroll, HR, Benefits and Retirement" (LinkedIn banner)
- "A leading provider of integrated human capital management solutions …" (LinkedIn bio)

- "As the future of work continues to evolve, Paychex leads the way by making complex HR, payroll, and benefits brilliantly simple"
- "Simplify Payroll, From Setup To Service and Support"
- "Simplify Administration and Support Compliance"

## QUICKBOOKS
**Founded:** 1983  
**HQ:** Mountain View, CA, USA  
**Employees:** 10,001+ on LinkedIn  
**Social:** 62,160 X followers @quickbooks

### Positioning Overview
**POSITIONING:** "We exist to help all businesses & freelancers succeed"  
**TAGLINE/THEMELINE:** Save time, make smart decisions, and grow your business with clarity.  
**TONE:** Self-assured. Techie. Somewhat flat.

### Messaging Strengths
**Big brand power has a can't-lose feel**
- "Trusted by millions of businesses worldwide"
- "Over 800 integrations"
- "TurboTax | Credit Karma | QuickBooks | Mailchimp"
- "Powering prosperity around the world" (Intuit mission)
- More than a dozen products featured

**Often "you-first," putting the prospect at the center of the conversation**
- "Your workload, unloaded"
- "Manage your accounting", "Manage your team", "Manage your money" (top nav organization of products & services)
- "Get the right info for you. Start by letting us know how many employees you have."
- "It started with you. Then it grew. Now it's also made of them. The people who make it possible. Your business is more than just you. That's why we made QuickBooks online payroll do more than just payroll." ("Payroll and beyond" video)

**"Free Tools" genuinely handy for small business owners**
- "Invoice generator"
- "Sales tax calculator"
- "Invoice templates"

### Messaging Weaknesses
**Robust homepage might overwhelm a small business owner**
- Massive navigation menu of offerings
- Sales promos, live chat, lots of videos instead of images
- Great that they can help with everything from accounting and taxes to project management, sales, and marketing … but where does a small business owner start?

**Unclear benefits language around "agents" could be deceptive**
- "Your dedicated Customer Agent finds leads and streamlines follow-up, giving you new opportunities to grow the business" ("Customer Agent" refers to an AI beta tool)
- "Stay on track with AI and Live experts available to help. Your Accounting Agent updates transactions, combines data, and spots inconsistencies." (The Accounting Agent is AI, not a human expert)
- "Amp up efficiency with AI agents and access to trusted experts" (it's unclear what kind of access)

**Missing personality**
- Social media presence is somewhat skeletal (no Instagram, abandoned X)
- Hero headline on homepage ("Your virtual team does virtually everything") falls a little flat
- Homepage has few real images or human faces
- No overarching tagline or creative theme

### Other Prominent Themes
**"AI"**
- "Backed by trusted experts and powerful AI automation, QuickBooks helps you save time, make smart decisions, and grow with clarity" (homepage hero subhead)
- "Your AI Accounting Agent helps tackle the tedious so you save time and stay focused on your business"
- "AI-Powered Insights"

## The villain?

### BACK-OFFICE BURNOUT

It's what happens when the paperwork, the deadlines, and the very real risk of getting something wrong all get to be too much.

**Examples of Back-Office Burnout:**
- When you get an IRS notification that your payroll taxes were miscalculated for Q2
- When you're manually tracking 15 employees' vacation days in three different spreadsheets
- When your I-9 forms are due for inspection, and half are missing required signatures
- When you realize you've been calculating overtime incorrectly for all your California employees
- When you spend your lunch break updating one employee's address in five different systems
- When you find out that three new hires weren't enrolled in the company health plan during their eligibility window
- When you're about to terminate an employee but have no idea what documentation you're required to provide
- When you're trying to run payroll reports, and the numbers don't match your accounting software
- When you've been withholding taxes for the wrong state, because your remote employee never told you he moved
- When you hang up and call the support number again, hoping the next person can actually answer your question
- When you've been classifying delivery drivers as 1099s, but they should have been W-2s
- When you've spent the last three nights on payroll and HR but still don't know if it's right

---

# POSITIONING OPPORTUNITY

In a world where you can spend forever on payroll and HR and still not know if you did everything correctly …

> — EXECUTIVE STRATEGY SESSION

---

## Imagine how this would feel from a prospect's point of view ...

> You've got to run payroll tomorrow. And of course, it's another off-cycle payroll. For a part-time employee. Who just moved states. Whose timesheets don't match your spreadsheets. And who – even though you didn't realize it – still hasn't sent you their signed I-9. It's always something. The burnout is real. And you're not even sure how you'll get it all done – much less, how you'll get it all right. But that's why there's Accrue. **Now you know it's right.™**

---

## TO KNOW IT'S RIGHT, YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO:

### 1. ELIMINATE THE ERRORS
Get the tools and services you need to prevent mistakes and correct any discrepancies.

**For example:**
- Get proactive guidance from experts who reach out to you with notifications and recommendations
- Know that fraud experts have an extra set of eyes on your transactions and processes
- Stay ahead of any issues with automated previews of your payroll summary, register, and more
- Receive regular reminders of exactly when payroll will run, so you can make sure you have the funds available
- Get as much help as you need to make sure it's done right – even if it means having us do it all for you

### 2. CRUSH THE COMPLEXITY
Say goodbye to the time-consuming tasks that make back-office activities so frustrating.

**For example:**
- Automate payroll, tax management, hiring, time tracking, and other HR tasks
- Give employees access to pay stubs, tax forms, and more from any device
- Streamline applicant tracking, onboarding, and even Work Opportunity Tax Credit processing
- Use customizable templates and compliance tools to manage labor laws and employee issues
- Hire and onboard faster, because you have the tools to simplify collaboration and speed the process

### 3. CALL ON AN EXPERT
Get hands-on help from payroll and HR specialists who know you and know your business.

**For example:**
- Connect with US-based payroll and HR specialists on call every day
- Get routed to someone who's worked with you and your business before
- Speak with SHRM-certified professionals about important HR issues
- Set up monthly check-ins with your HR rep to review the latest process changes and their effects

**Only Accrue enables you to do all this.**
