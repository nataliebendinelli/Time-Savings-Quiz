QUIZ STATISTICS VERIFICATION REPORT
=====================================
Generated: 2025-08-14
Purpose: Verify accuracy of all statistical claims in the Time-Savings Quiz

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================
After comprehensive analysis of the quiz files and research into current payroll industry statistics, several claims need attention. Some statistics are supportable, others need adjustment or clearer sourcing.

KEY STATISTICS FOUND IN QUIZ
============================

1. "10,000+ small businesses" (app/page.js:48, 67)
   STATUS: ⚠️ UNVERIFIED
   FOUND IN: Landing page hero section and trust indicators
   RESEARCH RESULT: No specific survey found claiming exactly "10,000+ small businesses" sample size
   RECOMMENDATION: Either provide source documentation or modify to "thousands of businesses"
   ALTERNATIVE: Use verified statistics from NSBA, OnPay, or other documented surveys

2. "15 hrs Average Time Saved/Month" (app/page.js:71-72)
   STATUS: ✅ PARTIALLY SUPPORTED
   RESEARCH RESULT: 
   - Small businesses report saving 8+ hours per pay period (90% reduction) with automation
   - One case study: processing time reduced from 15 hours to 2 hours per payroll cycle
   - 15-20% of business leaders' time freed up through payroll outsourcing
   - For bi-weekly payroll, 8 hours saved per period = 16 hours/month (close to claim)
   SOURCE: Multiple payroll industry reports 2024-2025
   RECOMMENDATION: Claim is reasonable but should specify "up to 15 hours" or "average 8-15 hours"

3. "94% Report Less Stress" (app/page.js:75-76)
   STATUS: ❌ LIKELY INACCURATE
   RESEARCH RESULT: 
   - Found 94% statistic related to payroll software integration preferences, not stress reduction
   - No verified source found for 94% stress reduction claim
   - Found: 50% of employees look for new job after 2 payroll errors (stress indicator)
   RECOMMENDATION: Remove this specific statistic or find verifiable source

4. Quiz Results - Hours Saved Calculations (app/quiz/page.js:95-117)
   STATUS: ✅ REASONABLE METHODOLOGY
   CALCULATIONS USED:
   - "Payroll Prisoner" (Score 16+): 15+ hours/month saved

   - "Semi-Streamlined" (Score 8-11): 4-8 hours/month (6 average)
   - "Payroll Pro" (Score <8): 2 hours/month saved
   RESEARCH SUPPORT: Aligns with industry data showing 5 hours per pay period for manual processing
   RECOMMENDATION: Methodology is sound based on research

5. "$85 hourly value" calculation (app/quiz/page.js:198)
   STATUS: ⚠️ NEEDS JUSTIFICATION
   RESEARCH RESULT: No specific source found for $85/hour business owner time value
   RECOMMENDATION: Should cite source (e.g., Bureau of Labor Statistics, small business owner salary data)

6. "20 hours per month saved" - Testimonial (app/page.js:186)
   STATUS: ✅ REASONABLE FOR TESTIMONIAL
   RESEARCH RESULT: Aligns with case studies showing 15-20 hour monthly savings
   RECOMMENDATION: Acceptable as individual testimonial if legitimate customer

7. "25 employees" company size (app/page.js:191)
   STATUS: ✅ REASONABLE
   RESEARCH RESULT: Fits target demographic for payroll pain points
   RECOMMENDATION: Acceptable

RISK ASSESSMENT

HIGH RISK: "94% Report Less Stress" - No verifiable source found
MEDIUM RISK: "10,000+ businesses" - Common marketing claim but needs documentation
LOW RISK: Time savings calculations - Methodology aligns with industry data

CONCLUSION
==========
Most statistics are reasonable and align with industry trends. Primary concerns are the unverified "94% stress reduction" claim and the specific "10,000+ businesses" sample size. Time savings calculations appear methodologically sound based on current industry data.

For legal compliance and credibility, recommend providing sources for all numerical claims or adjusting claims to reflect verifiable industry data.
